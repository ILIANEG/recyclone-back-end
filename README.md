# Recyclone
- A comprehensive API allowing collect and distribute locations of nearest recycling bin
- Project is in active development until May, 2021

## Current Stage
- Bsic functionality of public module is implemented, including:
    - Basic querying and adding of bins is implemented
- MongoDB is currently used as databsae solution

## Current Objectives
- Changing of error handling using middleware rather then end-point check
- Change algorithm for querying bins in radius. Working idea is to encode some data about location in id. It might involve changing databse system, but unlikely due to nature of collected requirments
- Start developing organization specific fetures (*Additional requirments have to be collected, so most probably another client meeting is required)

### Other information
- MIT license
    - License can change throughout the developmen process, but most certainly final project will be submitted under permissive open source license (due to nature of requirments collected)
